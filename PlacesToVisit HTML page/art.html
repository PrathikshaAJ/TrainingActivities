    <h2>Yakshagana</h2>


    <p>A trip to the coastal belt would be incomplete without watching the Yakshagana an elaborate dance drama performance unique to Karnataka. It is a rare combination of dance, music, song, scholarly dialogues and colourful costumes. A celestial world unfolds before the audience, as loud singing and drumming form a backdrop to dancers clad in striking costumes. Hence the name Yaksha (celestial) Gana (music). This is a night-long event, with elaborately adorned performers dancing to the beat of drums in open-air theatres usually in the village paddy fields after the winter crop has been harvested. Traditionally, men portray all roles, including the female ones, though women are now part of Yakshagana troupes. A typical troupe consists of 15 to 20 actors and a Bhagavatha, who is the master of ceremonies and the main story teller. The performances draw crowds from far and wide, with a fair-ground atmosphere pervading the venue till dawn.</p>

    <h2>Bhootaradhana</h2>
    <p>
        Bhootaradhana or Deity worship is very popular in Tulunadu. A ritual called nema or kola is performed for ghosts/gods. Conducting kola/nema has its own race and rules. The face is painted, wrapped in a Siri made of coconut feathers, and danced invoking the deity. The Divine Dancer gives justice to human beings and resolves disputes through the Word of God. Deity worship is the fundamental religious belief of the Tulu race.
